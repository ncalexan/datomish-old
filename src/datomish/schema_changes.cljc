  "Turn [[:db.part/db :db.install/attribute e] [e :db/ident :attr]] into {:attr {:db/* v}}.

  From http://docs.datomic.com/schema.html, :db/ident, :db/valueType,
  and :db/cardinality are required.  For us, enforce that valueType and
  cardinality are present at schema validation time.

  This code is not pretty, so here's what it does:

  Input: a sequence of datoms, like [e :keyword-attr v _ added].
  1. Select [:db.part/db :db.install/attribute ... ].
  2. Fail if any are not (= added true)
  3. For each [ :db.part/db :db.install/attribute e ], collect
     {e {:db/* v}}, dropping the inner :db/ident key.
  4. Map e -> ident; fail if not possible.
  5. Return the map, with ident keys.

  This would be more pleasant with `q` and pull expressions."
