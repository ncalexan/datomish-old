  It's worth noting that some amount of trial and error is probably
  necessary here, since [[-1 :ref -2] [-2 :ref -1]] is a valid input.
  It's my belief that no graph algorithm can correctly order the
  id-literals in quasi-linear time, since that algorithm will need to
  accept all permutations of the id-literals.  Therefore, we simplify
  by accepting that we may process the input multiple times, and we
  regain some efficiency by sorting so that upserts happen earlier and
  we are most likely to find a successful entid allocation without
  multiple trials.

  Concretely, we sort [-1 a v] < [-1 a -2] < [e a -1] < [e a v].  This
  means simple upserts will be processed early, followed by entities
  with multiple id-literals that we hope will reduce to simple upserts
  based on the earlier upserts.  After that, we handle what should be
  simple allocations."
